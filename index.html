    <h3>The History of Florida</h3>
    <p>Florida's history is a tapestry woven with Spanish exploration, colonial conflicts, and diverse cultural influences. From indigenous tribes thriving in its pre-Columbian era to Spanish settlement in St. Augustine in 1565, Florida has seen a complex interplay of European powers. It became a U.S. territory in 1822 and a state in 1845, witnessing growth fueled by tourism and agriculture. In the 20th century, Florida boomed, shaped by events like the Civil Rights Movement. Today, it stands as a vibrant state, celebrated for its blend of cultures and iconic landmarks.</p>

    <h2>Entry Requirements (International)</h2>
    <p>When flying into Florida from other countries, travelers typically go through immigration and customs checks upon arrival. This involves presenting passports, completing immigration forms, and declaring any goods being brought into the country. For flights within the US, passengers may still need to show identification but generally do not go through immigration and customs.</p>
